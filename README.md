# CL_Python_Project -

  My current project idea that I am considering is writing Python code that will integrate with Youtube Music so that some of the more mundane actions can be automated.  I'm still not sure how viable this project is, as I still have much research to do, but if it doesn't work out, I may persue something in line with my music or education background, since I have a degree in Music Education and 20 years of experience.
